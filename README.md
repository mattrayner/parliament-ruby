## Requirements
[parliament-ruby][parliament-ruby] requires the following:
* [Ruby][ruby] - [click here][ruby-version] for the exact version
* [Bundler][bundler]


## Installation
This gem is currently not available on RubyGems. To use it in an application, install it directly from GitHub via your Gemfile
```bash
gem 'parliament', git: 'https://github.com/ukparliament/parliament-ruby.git', branch: 'master'
```


## Usage
This gem's main function is fetching an n-triple file from a remote server and converting it into linked ruby objects.

### Setting up a connection
In order to connect to a remote server, we first need to set a base_url value, from which we will build an 'endpoint'. The base_url should be the beginning of a url without the trailing slash. For example `http://example.com` instead of `http://example.com/`.
```ruby
parliament = Parliament::Request.new(base_url: 'http://test.com')
```

#### Setting a base URL 'globally'
Within code you can set a global base URL using the following snippet.
```ruby
Parliament::Request.base_url = 'http://test.com'

# The base_url should be set for all new objects
Parliament::Request.new.base_url #=> 'http://test.com'

# You can still override the base_url on an instance by instance basis
Parliament::Request.new(base_url: 'http://example.com').base_url #=> 'http://example.com'
```

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable `PARLIAMENT_BASE_URL` on your machine and we will automatically use that.
```ruby
ENV['PARLIAMENT_BASE_URL'] #=> 'http://example.com'

Parliament::Request.base_url #=> nil

Parliament::Request.new.base_url #=> 'http://example.com'
```


### Building an 'endpoint'
Now that we have a `base_url` set, we will want to build an 'endpoint' such as: `http://test.com/parties/current.nt`.

An endpoint is effectively just a full URL to an n-triple file on a remote server.

Building an endpoint is simple, once you have a Parliament::Request object, you do something like this:
```ruby
parliament = Parliament::Request.new(base_url: 'http://test.com') #=>  #<Parliament::Request>

# target endpoint: 'http://test.com/parties/current.nt'
parliament.parties.current.get

# target endpoint: 'http://test.com/parties/123/people/current.nt'
parliament.parties('123').people.current.get

# target endpoint: 'http://test.com/people/123/letters/456.nt'
parliament.people('123').letters('456').get
```

#### What's #get?
Once you've built your endpoint (`parliament.people.current`), we use the `#get` method to tell us you're finished building and ready to get the data.
